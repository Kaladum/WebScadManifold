This is an early preview. Please use with caution.

WebScad-Manifold is a library and an editor for creating 3d models using js and ts. It is heavily inspired by [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and [jscad.app](https://jscad.app/). The [manifold-3d](https://www.npmjs.com/package/manifold-3d) library handles all geometry calculations.

You can use this project directly in the [browser](https://kaladum.github.io/WebScadManifold/).
